TWEET GENERATOR:

This project is a web-based Tweet Generator application that leverages Google's Gemini Generative AI API to create short, engaging tweets based on user input. Users can specify the topic, tone, target audience, and hashtags, and the app generates a tweet of under 280 characters that matches the given context. The backend is built using Flask, while the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface. The application demonstrates real-time AI integration, interactive form handling, and structured 
API communication. This project showcases practical usage of generative AI in content creation and is suitable for anyone looking to automate or enhance their social media engagement.
